# Processing code to visualize bacterial genome alignments as linear (instead of circular, e.g. by Circos)

This repository contains Processing scripts to make figures such as Figure 1 from Husnik & McCutcheon, PNAS 2016. It's still a work in progress (e.g. hard-coded variables), but I'll try to make these scripts more flexible in the near future.
